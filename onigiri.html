                <h5>Steps:</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Pop your cooked rice into a nice mixing bowl. Add the furikake or rice flavoring and mix through evenly. seperate the rice into equal portions, big enough to be a large handful.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Wet your hands with water and rub together with a pinch of salt. This will keep the rice from sticking to your hands and keeps the rice fresh for longer.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Take up one portion of rice in your hands.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>If you want to add fillings inside, make an indent now. Then, place the ingredients inside and fold the rice over. Lightly press it into a ball.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Using mainly your fingertips while resting the rice on your palm, start to press and squeeze the rice into a triangular shape, and rotate as you go to keep it even.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Place a slice of nori on the bottom of the onigiri (let the rough side of the seaweed face the rice). Then, fold it up towards the middle.</p>
                    </li>
