            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>This recipe is a simplified summary from Marc Matsumoto's rendition.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>To prepare the steak, you first want to mechanically tenderize it by cutting shallow slits into it at a 45-degree angle about a quarter-inch apart and about a third of the thickness of the steak deep. Then you can flip the steak over and repeat the same process at the same angle. This ensures the slits run perpendicular to each other on each side, so you don't risk cutting all the way through the steak. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Mix the chopped onions with salt and then surround the top and bottom of the steak with the onions. Cover the container up and refrigerate it overnight to let the onion enzymes do their thing. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The next day, scrape off all of the onions from the steak and then season both sides of the meat with black pepper. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat until very hot, and then add the vegetable oil and steak. Let the steak form a nice brown crust on one side, and then flip it over and brown the other side. Depending on how thick your steak is, you may need to turn down the heat and flip the steak a few more times to cook it through to your desired doneness. A rare steak will have an internal temperature of 120-130 degrees F, a medium-rare steak will be 130-140 degrees F, and it goes up in 10-degree increments until you reach well done at 160 degrees F. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>When the steak is done, transfer it to a plate and let it rest. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>To prepare the sauce, turn down the heat and add the onions to the pan you cooked the steak in. Saute the onions until they're tender but still retain their shape. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add the soy sauce to the onions and continue to saute as you stir until the liquid has evaporated and the soy sauce starts to caramelize to the pan. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Deglaze the pan with the red wine and let the mixture boil until the amount of liquid has reduced by about half. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Finish the sauce by vigorously whisking in the cold butter until the sauce is thick and creamy. Don't overcook the sauce at this point, or the fat will separate out and make the onions greasy. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>After the steak has had a chance to rest, slice it up as thinly as possible by holding the knife at a 45-degree angle to the cutting board. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>To assemble the donburi, fill bowl with the rice and then top with sliced steak. Next, add onion sauce then finish with a sprinkle of chopped scallions. </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
